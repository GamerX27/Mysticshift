Mysticshift
This is a simple web application that allows a user to encrypt and decrypt text using the Caesar Cipher, a simple substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of positions down the alphabet.

The web application takes user input in the form of a plaintext message and a shift value, and then applies the Caesar Cipher algorithm to produce an encrypted message. The encrypted message can then be decrypted using the same shift value.

The application has been enhanced to include a dark mode button, which when clicked, toggles the background color, text color, and other styles to a dark mode theme. This is achieved by adding a new button element and a JavaScript function that toggles a "dark-mode" class on the body element, which has associated styles that change the appearance of the page.
